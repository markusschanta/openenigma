This repository contains the Arduino code for the [S&T GeoTronics M4 Enigma](https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-your-own-Enigma-Replica/).
The S&T GeoTronics M4 Enigma is an Arduino Mega custom shield programmed to replicate the behavior of a [German M4 Enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine).
It consistes of 4 16-Segment units, 5 LEDs, 26 Lamps setup as keyboard, 26 keyboard buttons & 10 Function keys. The 115 light emitting diodes are multi-plexed. This minimizes the amount of pins needed to control them down to 38 pins and all 36 pushbuttons keys are sharing a total of 4 pins.

## Installation Instructions

Depending on your type of kit, you need to install the relevant version of the code onto the Arduino:

 - **[Open Enigma M4](Open%20Enigma%20M4.ino)**
 - **[Open Enigma M4 with Plugboard](Open%20Enigma%20M4%20Plugboard.ino)**

## Operation Instructions

To understand how to operate the S&T GeoTronics M4 Enigma, please refer to the following guide:

## Release Notes

 - Designed, assembled & programmed by Marc Tessier & James Sanderson 20/9/13.
 - Modified for Prototype PCB pair on 4/12/13.
 - Modified to obey doublesteping and have M3 function 22/3/14.
