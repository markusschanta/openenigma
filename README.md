This repository contains the Arduino code for the [S&T GeoTronics M4 Enigma](https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-your-own-Enigma-Replica/).
The S&T GeoTronics M4 Enigma is an Arduino Mega custom shield programmed to replicate the behavior of a [German M4 Enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine).
It consistes of 4 16-Segment units, 5 LEDs, 26 Lamps setup as keyboard, 26 keyboard buttons & 10 Function keys. The 115 light emitting diodes are multi-plexed. This minimizes the amount of pins needed to control them down to 38 pins and all 36 pushbuttons keys are sharing a total of 4 pins.

## Operation Instructions
